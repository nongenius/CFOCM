CFOCM
=====

An overlapping protein complexes prediction method based on core-attachment structure and function annotations

CFOCM: Main function for protein complexes prediction

CFOCM_CORE: Detect cores of protein complexes

CFOCM_ATTACH: Append attachment proteins to the detected cores.

Evaluation: evaluating measures, F-measure, precision, recall .etc


PPNHandle: for reading input PPI network

GoAnnotation: for maping proteins to GO items and calculate functional interdepence between each GO item pair


MaxcliquesALG: Finding maxinum cluques in PPI network

FileOperation: file operations, such as save, read....
